                I like to play ski, and during the winter I love to go in Italy close to my house.
                But there is since few years something really annoying there.
                The tunnel which is 3km long is one way only and the road traffic is alternative thanks to a beautiful
                red light of 25min.
                The new hope is italy side installed a public webcam on their side. I have created a server which
                computes the remaining time
                of the red light on both side by analyzing the webcam picture.<br/>
                I used OpenCV to do image analysis and then I have created the android app for better UX. I played with
                the framework flutter which is cross platform for a potential iOS app.

                Toolchain with the goal to help a Dungeon Master to run a D&D game.
                This is not yet another online role playing game tool,
                it is meant to be used for live pen and papers sessions.
                All dice rolls should be done IRL,
                the toolchain should only provide information on what to do but
                not do it for you.

                The project is being improved a lot. We made a separation between backend and frontend and we introduced
                a grid. The grid purpose is to display the game to other players and have a virtual map of the game (a
                bit like the website Roll20).
